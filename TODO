* don't modify links to other mutations of breviar.sk!
* insert a notice in the pages on how eantifonar works, with a link to "clean" ebreviar.cz

* indexer:
	* index antiphons with alleluia also without it.
	* save modus and eventually differentia
	* if a repo is not specified, make a fresh temporary clone in /tmp
	* prettier images
	* save chant source (will help to manually look up a missing - unmatched - chant)
		- as path relative to project root
		- as name (title of the master Lilypond file)
	* by default only reindex files that changed since the last indexing

* (bonus) find where exactly httpclient clashed with Sinatra and eventually send a bug report

* index: chant type and subtype? (Magnificat antiphon is also an antiphon)
