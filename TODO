# BASIC FEATURES, BUGS

* database browsing to a separate controller?
* modularize decorator? (It would be nice to have the player pluggable and possibly other parts, too.)

* integration tests testing if ebreviar's web interface has changed; they should be run daily, results displayed on eantifonar and reported to me

* update-task
	* should write a new commit file (used in the About view)
* player - fix broken

* reference listing of all psalmtones in use

* error pages

* find the right size and resolution of the score images

* psalter responsories must have the doxology notated

* point psalms
* include Deus in adiutorium, final blessing, Te Deum
* include hymn tunes (permission needed?)

* caching of decorated pages to handle requests for identical content without redundant processing

* fix the 'open door' in static_content // prove'n'test there is no

* move hardcoded paths to a shared config object

* indexer:
	* find why mogrify often doesn't find the png created by lilypond
	* log: identify file by it's relative path, score by it's fial
	* mode refreshing selected files, regardless of their being unmodified etc.
	* chants with modified lyrics (often because of small rhythmical change) should have the original text in some header field; use this in the index
	* save chant source as name (title of the Lilypond (master-)file)

	* run lilypond and mogrify in several concurrent processes

	* if a repo is not specified, make a fresh temporary clone in /tmp
	* prettier images
	* should work correctly with output dir just anywhere, shouldn't it?

* database listing:
	* preserve filter while browsing between list pages
	* ordering

* way to choose antiphon manually (both when a fitting chant is and isn't found automatically)

* css
	* alternative layout for small displays
	* print style (without buttons, background)

* player
	* controls
		* to adjust tempo
		* to transpose
	* don't allow playing more than one piece at a time
	* at the first piece played the first few notes are always played very quickly. why?
	* catch the "audio resources unavailable" error and alert the user to reload page

* some pretty back-to-the-front-page link for the inner pages

# NICE TO HAVE

* cope with any settings modifying ebreviar's output (currently only the default output is supported)

* cron task pulling changes from github and reindexing changed files

* (bonus) find where exactly httpclient clashed with Sinatra and eventually send a bug report
* indexer: for antiphons with alleluia not only index lyrics without it, but also compile an alleluia-stripped score
* an API to access the contents of the database?
* each antiphon could be accompanied by a link to the pdf on inadiutorium.cz
