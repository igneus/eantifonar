* don't modify links to other mutations of breviar.sk!
* insert a notice in the pages on how eantifonar works, with a link to "clean" ebreviar.cz

* indexer:
	* if a repo is not specified, make a fresh temporary clone in /tmp
	* prettier images
	* save chant source (will help to manually look up a missing - unmatched - chant)
		- as path relative to project root
		- as name (title of the master Lilypond file)
	* by default only reindex files that changed since the last indexing

* blacklist and some way to give priority (scores from some files should never be shown in the web antiphonal, e.g.
	because they don't fit to the gregorian psalm tones; others are a 'second option' and shouldn't be shown by default)

* (bonus) find where exactly httpclient clashed with Sinatra and eventually send a bug report

* index: chant type and subtype? (Magnificat antiphon is also an antiphon)

* logging

* include psalm tones
* point psalms

* each antiphon could be accompanied by a link to the respective ly source on github and pdf on inadiutorium.cz
* way to choose antiphon manually (both when a fitting chant is and isn't found automatically)
