# BASIC FEATURES, BUGS

* logging

* include psalm tones
* point psalms
* include responsories
* include Deus in adiutorium, final blessing, Te Deum

* caching

* meaningful <title>

* fix the 'open door' in static_content

* move hardcoded paths to a shared config object

* indexer:
	* lyrics for searching should be stripped of interpunction
	* chants with modified lyrics (often because of small rhythmical change) should have the original text in some header field; use this in the index
	* save chant source as name (title of the Lilypond (master-)file)

	* check what the external processes (lilypond, mogrify) return!
		- don't save Chant that doesn't compile

	* if a repo is not specified, make a fresh temporary clone in /tmp
	* prettier images
	* should work correctly with output dir just anywhere, shouldn't it?

* database listing:
	* preserve filter while browsing between list pages

* blacklist and some way to give priority (scores from some files should never be shown in the web antiphonal, e.g.
	because they don't fit to the gregorian psalm tones; others are a 'second option' and shouldn't be shown by default)

* hymn tunes

* each antiphon could be accompanied by a link to the pdf on inadiutorium.cz
* way to choose antiphon manually (both when a fitting chant is and isn't found automatically)

* an API to access the contents of the database?

* css
	* alternative layout for small displays
	* print style (without buttons, background)

* some pretty back-to-the-front-page link for the inner pages

* cron task pulling changes from github and reindexing changed files

# NICE TO HAVE

* (bonus) find where exactly httpclient clashed with Sinatra and eventually send a bug report
* indexer: for antiphons with alleluia not only index lyrics without it, but also compile an alleluia-stripped score
