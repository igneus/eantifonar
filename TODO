* don't modify links to other mutations of breviar.sk!
* insert a notice in the pages on how eantifonar works, with a link to "clean" ebreviar.cz

* indexer: if a repo is not specified, make a fresh temporary clone in /tmp
* indexer: prettier images
* indexer: save chant source (will help to manually look up a missing - unmatched - chant)
	- as path relative to project root
	- as name (title of the master Lilypond file)
* indexer: save modus and eventually differentia (later we will point the psalms, too)

* (bonus) find where exactly httpclient clashed with Sinatra and eventually send a bug report

* index: chant type and subtype? (Magnificat antiphon is also an antiphon)
